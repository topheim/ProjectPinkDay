					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for sharing! Your experiences and findings reminds me everyday to keep things I need to a minimal. I found myself cleaning then accumulating some more. But I am getting up to the courage to do the same soon. sometimes, I read it multiple times for a daily reminder! This is such a inspiring and encouraging blog, because you really did it! leaving nice career, stable life behind and just go for it. It really makes me feel that I can do it too (instead of just &quot;day dreaming&quot;). because it is so real! I look forward to read more about your journey and findings. I started a blog so long ago and did not even try to keep it going. so I will start again. thanks to you.]]></description>
