					<description><![CDATA[Hello - somehow playing on Linkedin I saw this connection and was intrigued. Debbie worked with me on Catalyst and I check occasionally to see how people are doing. I totally love what you are doing and want to applaud you both for having the smarts and the courage to chase your dream. 
I came home to Vancouver Island when I left Kraft in 2010 and found myself wondering how I had stayed away so long. I have the PACIFIC Ocean at my doorstep - one block away - ocean creatures, beautiful parks and gardens and a very laid back healthy lifestyle. Even though you may both work in the same professional fields again, your relationships with your kids will be forever better for the wonderful memories you are creating. Bravo to you both and hi to Debbie for me.]]></description>
