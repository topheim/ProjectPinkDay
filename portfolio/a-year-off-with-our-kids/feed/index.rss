					<description><![CDATA[It is such a serendipity, that I looked at your Facebook garage sale, looking for an item to put in my new home to start my Airbnb. I did not get the item, but I came to your website and feeling so excited for you. And I admire and support you as I have been wanting to do the same for so long! I have met a couple named John and Lisa in 2009, they did the same. And they live on half of their incomes than when what they had before but they were such inspiration. they encouraged me but I have been taking only baby steps for the past 5 years. Still I am proud of my baby steps. And thank you to family like yours, just make me feel I can do it too. 
Here is John and Lisa’s little inn in Wisconsin on Facebook. They wrote a couple of books together and home schooled their son who has now grown into a quite accomplished young boy.

you probably can find most of their books, stories through their page. I look forward to hear about your adventure. Best wishes.]]></description>
