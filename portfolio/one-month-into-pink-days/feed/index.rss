					<description><![CDATA[My Dear Girl,

You brought me to tears.  Those are some pretty insightful and heart-warming learnings.  I am so incredibly proud of both you and Travis for following your hearts and making this dream come true.
I remember the day, long before the inception of PPD, Travis telling me his number one goal in life is to be the best dad he can possibly be.  You are both amazing parents and it shows in your beautiful children&#039;s faces.
I look forward to watching the four of you grow in life and love in the coming year.

Love always,
Grammy]]></description>
