					<description><![CDATA[Hey Project Pink, we are about to leave our jobs and home for a townhouse in Tennessee (to call home base) and then Feb 12th we are off to Southeast Asia until May.  We hope our posts will be as much fun as yours.  However we will be telling people who are a bit OLDER, how to travel on a budget.  Watch FB for the announcement of our Travel Blog.  

Congratulations on being visionary in order to sort out exactly what you are looking for from life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelley,

Today is my birthday a big one...and Friday is my last day at Lapp Chiro.  It is all bittersweet.  I so admire your fortitude and think of you guys often.  I will be at YouthBuild working for a nonprofit January first teaching health care and helping students complete their GED.  i have passed the office torch onto Elizabeth Eles a newer younger version of me.  She will do well with the patients.
